# Webscraping Project

## Introduction
Predictive modeling on automobile pricing by scraping over sixty thousand pre-owned vehicle records throuhg comercial website.

## Background
The basic concept of 4Ps in marketing is Price, Product, Promotion and Place. Price is always in the first place and it is the most important factor when executing a marketing mix. Because of my background in marketing and automobile industry, I decided to scrap the second largest classified automotive website: Cars.com. With over 58,000 used cars' observations within 30 miles range of New York City Area across a total of 34 brands, I was able to do some handy practice in Data cleaning & manipulation and simple multiple linear regression modeling with this dataset I scrapped with Python Scrapy.
